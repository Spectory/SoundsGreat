# Sounds Great

"… Results indicated that state positive affect and quality-of-work were lowest with no music, while time-on-task was longest when music was removed. Narrative responses revealed the value of music listening for positive mood change and enhanced perception on design while working..."​

The effect of music listening on work performance, Research by Teresa Lesiuk 

# Getting Started

Run `npm install`
Run `ng build`
Run `ng serve`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Logger Logic

The loggers track mouse movements and key strokes events (not recording the key strokes only a signed that you clicked the keyboard)
Install the following: `sudo apt-get install python-tk`

Run `sudo ./runloggers.sh` in the Logger Directory , two files will be created keyboardevets.txt and mouseevents.txt
which include the logger output in a json form


# Prerequisites

Angular 2 (CLI) 

Python 2.7

# Running the tests


Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

# Template

The template includes the following:


1. Two components each having a reducer and a root reducer in app.reducer.ts. The intention here is NOT to have a reducer for each component in the projcet, rather only for main components, generally the ones representing major parts of the app. 

2. A router for selecting between the components

3. Both components dispaly how to perform async actions with state changes.

4. An example test for the users reducer
